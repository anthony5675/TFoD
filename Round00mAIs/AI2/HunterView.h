// For Dracula
// * the pastPlays string should contain full details of all moves
// * the last move should always be by Mina Harker
//
// messages is an array containing a playerMessage for each play in the game
// so far. It will have exactly the same number of elements as there are plays
// in pastPlays. The message from the first play will be at index 0, and so on.
// The contents of each playerMessage will be exactly as provided by the player.

// 'player' specifies which players's life/blood points to return
//    and must be a value in the interval [0...4] (see 'player' type)

// May be UNKNOWN_LOCATION if the player has not had a turn yet

//   {29, 12, -1, -1, -1, -1}
// This would mean in the first move the player started on location 12
//   then moved to the current location of 29
