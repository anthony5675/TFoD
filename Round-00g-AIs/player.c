/**
 * Runs a player's game turn ...
 *
 * Can produce either a Hunter player or a Dracula player
 * depending on the setting of the I_AM_DRACULA #define
 *
 * This is a dummy version of the real player.c used when
 * you submit your AIs. It is provided so that you can
 * test whether your code is likely to compile ...
 *
 * Note that it used to drive both Hunter and Dracula AIs.
 * It first creates an appropriate view, and then invokes the
 * relevant decide-my-move function, which should use the 
 * registerBestPlay() function to send the move back.
 *
 * The real player.c applies a timeout, so that it will halt
 * decide-my-move after a fixed amount of time, if it doesn't
 * finish first. The last move registered will be the one
 * used by the game engine. This version of player.c won't stop
 * your decide-my-move function if it goes into an infinite
 * loop. Sort that out before you submit.
 *
 * Based on the program by David Collien, written in 2012
